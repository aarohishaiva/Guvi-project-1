However, her wings are cut when her family presents her with two choices. Her mother forces Salem to marry Muzzafar, their neighbour. The only way to avoid marriage is if Sanem finds herself a decent job. At such short notice, Salem starts working in an advertising firm. Not only that solves her problem at home but she also meets the love of her life at her new workplace. However, little does she know that she has walked right into a bigger trap. Will Sanem find a place for herself in the fancy corporate world?

You see, I believe that it is through difficult situations and great pain that the human spirit grows and character is developed.  And my story is a testament to this.\\nI started in the fitness industry when I was only 18 years old, and I knew that it was where I belonged.  I had always been into fitness and enjoyed being active through my whole childhood.  I was involved in Martial Arts, Wrestling and Football throughout high school and was generally a very physical person.  I have been in the field for 26+ years and plan to stay here for many more.  While I always enjoyed my work and was successful with it, I was not as passionate then as I am now.  The passion didn’t come until much later.  The passion came through the most painful loss I have ever experienced…\" – Coach Pain\\n\\n►Follow Coach Pain:\\nYouTube: http://bit.ly/2LmRyea\\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/2XLcLW5\\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/32tZdNi\\nWebsite: http://bit.ly/2YTgWvq\\nBook Coach Pain: http://bit.ly/2JMefFu\\nJoin the Coach Pain Academy: http://bit.ly/2XNmUfT\\n\\n►Follow Motiversity on Social Media\\nFind us everywhere: https://linktr.ee/motiversity\\nDiscord: https://bit.ly/motiversitydiscord\\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/motiversityfacebook \\nInstagram: https://bit.ly/motiversityinstagram\\nTikTok: https://bit.ly/motiversitytiktok\\nWebsite: https://bit.ly/motiversitywebsite\\n\\n►Follow Motiversity on Music and Podcast Platforms\\nSpotify Music: http://bit.ly/Motiversity\\nApple Music: http://bit.ly/MotiversityAppleMusic\\nMotivation Daily Podcast: https://linktr.ee/MotivationDailybyMotiversity\\nMindset App: https://bit.ly/MotiversityonMindset \\n\\nFollow all the Motiversity YouTube Channels\\nhttps://bit.ly/motiversityyoutubechannels\\n\\n►Music\\nArn Andersson - Farewell Life\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD0XEH3qVCk\\n\\n►Video footage: All video footage used is either licensed through either CC-BY or from various stock footage websites.

Ah yes it’s called “Death Note.”  Americanized version of a similar story line… how original.  That covers the first 20 min. of this movie so I’m pretty sure I could ruin the remainder of this movie for others who are not familiar w/the anime “Death Note,” but I’ll refrain from doing so &amp; I’m so terribly bored that this oughta at least be another hours of semi distraction to kill some of this hum drum day with.  I’m sure a good bit of us can totally relate to both sides of the coin on using a death note if there was in fact such a thing.  Only difference is the anime kills there are no accidental incidents that only wreak havoc leaving a victim alive.  &amp; we know already the friend who knows about this notebook is ultimately going to have to die b/c they already know too much that’s a given.  The other interesting difference is the rules the anime had notebook rules which made the notebook also even more so dangerous as well to whomever it’s user was as well.  Specific instructions.  How many of you would decide to go ahead &amp; scribble around in such a notebook if you already knew the consequences like the anime or if you discovered it’s abilities after using once like in this movies version of a similar type of death note existing?  Be honest if you answer.  I’ve thought about it &amp; I can think of a few ppl &amp; I’d consider like Kira did so initially too using to basically put an end to all violent homicidal murderous crimes around the world.  I can relate to how much more simple it would then from there potentially come to using it easily just like both versions, it would be very tempting if it really existed for not just selfish reasons but also in such ways viewed that would be overall better for all, but I’m not God is always my very last thought &amp; thank God I’m not God b/c I don’t want that nor any other one of those Godly type of responsibilities of judgement over anyone else b/c it weighs too heavy on my heart, my spirit, my mind if I think about it deeply &amp; seriously.  &amp; really I’d be no better than the victims I’d choose for betterment on a whole as well as on a personal selfish basis for whom I truly care nothing for but for whom have caused me very poorly &amp; deeply hurt me &amp; I feel enmity for their transgressions against me which are those unforgivable kinds of transgressions not just those stupid idiotic cliché types, but those things that even God Himself does not forgive.  &amp; then I think about how powerful words written, thought, or vocalized can be too…. thank God such a notebook like in the movies doesn’t actually exist that I’m aware of &amp; if it does do not put it in my hands please it would be too much of a temptation I can admit that much, but I don’t want to resort or do anything that would pretty much sink me down to the same level as those I could easily see writing down myself in such a notebook myself b/c the consequences for eternity just aren’t ultimately truly worth it.  Let God have at it that is not some responsibility I’d gladly accept.  😊', 'comment_author': '@audrtuviashartel8291', 'comment_published_at': '2024-02-18T21:00:39Z'}, {'comment_text': 'What a classic this was…', 'comment_author': '@Its_TiCha', 'comment_published_at': '2024-02-17T05:14:38Z'}, {'comment_text': 'well worth watching 8 / 10', 'comment_author': '@contritisumus', 'comment_published_at': '2024-02-15T08:22:59Z'}, {'comment_text': '2 11 24', 'comment_author': '@myrnalane7928', 'comment_published_at': '2024-02-13T01:25:31Z'}, {'comment_text': 'still watching in 2024', 'comment_author': '@set6999', 'comment_published_at': '2024-02-12T21:41:53Z'}, {'comment_text': 'Me me me me', 'comment_author': '@frankmartinez6027', 'comment_published_at': '2024-02-12T21:36:39Z'}, {'comment_text': 'Leo from charmed', 'comment_author': '@kellybarraclough', 'comment_published_at': '2024-02-11T21:43:32Z'}, {'comment_text': 'Me😂', 'comment_author': '@user-zi1cp7jw7q', 'comment_published_at': '2024-02-11T16:25:24Z'}, {'comment_text': 'Ésta película superó mis expectativas!!

Maybe it&#39;s why the suicide rates are so high? I might have tried it myself seriously but I&#39;m a coward and who knows what&#39;s on the other side of death for your immortal soul?

I think really bad cases of clinical depression could be helped by the maximum daily doses of Prozac till you&#39;ve levelled out and can drop down to a lower dose.
